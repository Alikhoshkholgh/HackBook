# UAC:
- The differences we are interested in are restrictions imposed by User Account Control (UAC) over local administrators (except for the default Administrator account). By default, **local administrators won't be able to remotely connect to a machine** and perform administrative tasks unless using an interactive session through **RDP**. Windows will deny any administrative task requested via RPC, SMB or WinRM since such administrators will be logged in with a filtered medium integrity token, preventing the account from doing privileged actions. The only local account that will get full privileges is the default Administrator account.
- **Domain accounts with local administration privileges** won't be subject to the same treatment and will be logged in with **full administrative privileges**.
